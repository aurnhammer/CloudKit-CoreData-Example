 Abstract:
 These types are used by the game's AI to capture and evaluate a snapshot of the game's state. `EntityDistance` encapsulates the distance between two entities. `AdventureStateSnapshot` stores an `EntitySnapshot` for every entity in the adventure. `EntitySnapshot` stores the distances from an entity to every other entity in the Adventure.
